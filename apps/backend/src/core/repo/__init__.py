'''
what exactly is REPO ?
this are basically abstarcted methods that can later be implemented using your choice of DATABASE i.e - Mongo
, SQL , postgress etc. 
this is important as even if u chnage DB the methods will not change so the APP will not break 
So that is why it is app agnostic 

the ACTUAL implemenetion is in infrastructure/repo
